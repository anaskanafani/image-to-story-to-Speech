# **Image-to-Story-to-Speech Transformer** 🖼️➡️📝➡️🔊

### **About** ✍️  
This project involves the development of an advanced AI pipeline that leverages **Hugging Face models** and **large language models (LLMs)** to seamlessly transform images into rich, auditory experiences. The pipeline automatically generates descriptive captions from images, then crafts engaging and contextually relevant stories based on those captions, and finally converts the stories into lifelike speech. This project showcases the integration of vision, language, and speech synthesis technologies to create a comprehensive storytelling experience.
