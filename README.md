# **Hand-Written-Digits-DCGAN** ✍️🔢

### **About** ✍️  
This project focuses on creating a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to generate highly realistic handwritten digits. By leveraging the power of deep learning, the model is trained to learn the intricate patterns and variations present in handwritten digits, enabling it to produce new, authentic-looking samples that mimic human handwriting. The project demonstrates the capability of GANs to capture and replicate fine-grained details in image generation tasks, particularly in the domain of digit synthesis.
